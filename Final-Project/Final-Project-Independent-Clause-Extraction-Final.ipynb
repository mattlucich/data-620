      "Biden's retelling was perhaps the most inaccurate version of the story he had told -- although it wasn't the only time he told it, according to the Post.\n",
      "However, according to the Post, multiple details of the story Biden tells are inaccurate, including the people involved and the timing of the incident.\n",
      "The version of Biden’s story that’s true — and just as heart-rending — is one he rarely tells.\n",
      "\"This is Biden at top form, where he does this vivid, coherent, brilliant narrative, in which not a single detail is correct,\" he said.\n",

    "Once again, I use the sentence similarity model to compare sentence pairs. This time I am comparing all sentence and clause combinations and retaining only pairs with similarity scores above .7, a heuristic chosen after thorough manual review. The idea is sentence and clause pairs above .7 represent text covering the same story aspect. This will ultimately let us know what news outlets are not including the core aspects of the story. We can see from the results that while the sentence comparisons lead to more successful results (as determined by filtering criteria), the clause comparison provide incremental story aspect matches. For now, including both approaches appears to be the optimal approach. Additionally, improving the clause algorithm, which currently discards a high number of clauses, will likely improve the volume of successful results."
